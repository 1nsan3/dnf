0.3.1 Release Notes
===================

0.3.1 brings mainly changes to the automatic metadata synchronization. In
Fedora, ``dnf makecache`` is triggered via SystemD timers now and takes an
optional ``background`` extra-argument to run in resource-considerate mode (no
syncing when running on laptop battery, only actually performing the check at
most once every three hours). Also, the IO and CPU priorities of the
timer-triggered process are lowered now and shouldn't as noticably impact the
system's performance.

The administrator can also easily disable the automatic metadata updates by
setting :ref:`metadata_timer_sync <metadata_timer_sync-label>` to 0.

The default value of :ref:`metadata_expire <metadata_expire-label>` was
increased from 6 hours to 48 hours. In Fedora, the repos usually set this
explicitly so this change is not going to cause much impact.

The following reported issues are fixed in this release:

* :rhbug:`916657`
* :rhbug:`921294`
* :rhbug:`922521`
* :rhbug:`926871`
* :rhbug:`878826`
* :rhbug:`922664`
* :rhbug:`892064`
* :rhbug:`919769`
