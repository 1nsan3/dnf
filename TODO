Things that must be done:

Critical:
 - make the cmdline options (-d, -q ,-y etc) be pushed into the config.conf 
   class so we don't have to pass them around
 - Implement pkg excludes for new packages on the client side
 - Implement pkg excludes on the server side
 - Make -q and -d 0 VERY quiet
 - quiet down the callback for rpm installs if -q is invoked.
 - Make the syslog, log be sane

Important:
- gzip the headers so they are smaller to move across the network
- Work on making the frontend more spiffy/more responsive when 
  running in interactive mode
- Implement a status/progress bar for downloading pkgs
- put together a brief quickstart guide and a webpage.
- Implement the comps parsing and group* functions
- Implement a server-side config file or commandline option to let it 
  know where to get the comps/group list from
- Implement some sort of silly lock file for making sure two yum's can't be run 
  at the same time



Useful:
- sanity check on the rpmdb:
  option 1 - don't do it - write an external script to do it and it 
    attempts to fix the rpmdb if its broken by looking to see if we
	have what it needs. If its a conflict, then tell them they need 
	to sort that out themselves :)
  option 2 - have it - and just make it optional to be listened to.

  option 3 - have it - but fork it into the background so it occurs 
    while the header download is happening  or something like that - 
    that way it doesn't seemto take nearly as fscking long.



Wishlist/Cool:
- Make it possible to have an http-accesible global conf file for excludes and
  what not.
- work on making file urls work (ick)
- test on non x86 archs and make sure grub and lilo stuff are not run for this 
  arch possibly implement a per-arch pkgaction.kernelupdate function
- make an option for:
  yum mail notices
  so that it could be used to check for updates and mail root@ or 
  config option admin=blah@host.com what updates are available
  MAYBE even listing the description or summary of the package
  with the update.
  it'd be silly but nice for people who don't want it running automatically
