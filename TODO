Things that must be done:

Put the sigcheck function in :)
 make it an option per server not global.

fix the nevral so newest wins for the headerInfoNevral by default and
last-in as an option.

Implement the comps parsing and group* functions
Implement clean * - shouldn't be terribly hard.

Implement pkg excludes for new packages on the client side
Implement pkg excludes on the server side
Implement a server-side config file or commandline option to let it know where to get the comps/group list from

Make it possible to have an http-accesible global conf file for excludes and
what not.

gzip the headers so they are smaller to move across the network

Implement a status/progress bar for downloading pkgs
Make -q and -d 0 VERY quiet
Make the syslog, log be sane

rewrite the man pages so they have some meaning :)

Work on making the frontend more spiffy

quiet down the callback for rpm installs if -q is invoked.

work on making ftp and file urls work

test on non x86 archs and make sure grub and lilo stuff are not run for this arch
possibly implement a per-arch pkgaction.kernelupdate function

implement some sort of silly lock file for making sure two yum's can't be run at the same time
