 DNF API Reference
*******************

.. WARNING::

  At this  point the  DNF API is  not usable  in any way.  It is  incomplete and
  changing rapidly.  This documentation mostly  takes over whatever  classes and
  methods were documented  in Yum at the  point of DNF fork.  Note that methods,
  classes   and  entire   modules  might   still  be   removed,  redesigned   or
  modified. Others will  be added to replace or supplement  them. Please `get in
  touch  with  me <https://github.com/akozumpl/dnf/wiki#wiki-Contact>`_  if  you
  have ideas or suggestions about the form of the future API.
