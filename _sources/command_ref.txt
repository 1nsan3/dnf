Commands

For an explanation of ``<package-spec>`` see :ref:`\specifying_packages-label`.

For an explanation of ``<provide-spec>`` see :ref:`\specifying_provides-label`.

--------------------
Check Update Command
--------------------

``dnf [options] check-update [<package-specs>...]``

    Non-interactively checks if updates of the specified packages are
    available. If no ``<package-specs>`` are given checks whether any updates at
    all are available for your system. DNF exit code will be 100 when there are
    updates available and a list of the updates will be printed, 0 if not and 1
    if an error occurs.

-------------
Clean Command
-------------
Performs cleanup of temporary files for the currently enabled repositories.

``dnf clean dbcache``
    Removes cache files generated from the repository metadata. This forces DNF
    to regenerate the cache files the next time it is run.

``dnf clean expire-cache``
    Removes local cookie files saying when the metadata and mirrorlists were
    downloaded for each repo. DNF will revalidate the cache for each repo the
    next time it is used.

``dnf clean metadata``
    Removes repository metadata. Those are the files which DNF uses to determine
    the remote availability of packages. Using this option will make DNF
    download all the metadata the next time it is run.

``dnf clean packages``
    Removes any cached packages from the system.  Note that packages are not
    automatically deleted after they are downloaded.

``dnf clean plugins``
    Tells all enabled plugins to eliminate their cached data.

``dnf clean all``
    Does all of the above.

-----------------
Downgrade Command
-----------------
``dnf [options] downgrade <package-specs>...``
    Downgrades the specified packages to the highest of all known lower versions.

-------------
Erase Command
-------------
``dnf [options] erase <package-specs>...``
    Removes the specified packages from the system along with any packages
    depending on the packages being removed. If ``clean_requirements_on_remove``
    is enabled also removes any dependencies that are no longer needed.

------------
Help Command
------------

``dnf help [<command>]``
    Displays the help text for all commands. If given a command name then only
    displays the help for that particular command.

---------------
History Command
---------------

The history command allows the user to view what has happened in past
transactions (assuming the ``history_record`` configuration option is set).

``dnf history [list]``
    The default history action is listing all known transaction information in a
    table.

``dnf history info [<transaction_id>]``
    Describe the given transaction. When no ID is given describes what happened
    during the latest transacton.

------------
Info Command
------------

``dnf [options] info <package-specs>...``
    Is used to list a description and summary information about available packages.

---------------
Install Command
---------------
``dnf [options] install <package-specs>...``
    Installs the specified packages and their dependencies. After the
    transaction is finished all the specified packages are installed on the
    system.

------------
List Command
------------

Dumps lists of packages depending on the packages' relation to the
system. Generally packages are available (it is present in a repository we know
about) or installed (present in the RPMDB). The list command can also limit the
displayed packages according to other criteria, e.g. to only those that update
an installed package.

All the forms take a ``[<package-specs>...]`` parameter to further limit the
result to only those packages matching it.

``dnf [options] list [all] [<package-specs>...]``
    Lists all packages known to us, present in the RPMDB, in a repo or in both.

``dnf [options] list installed [<package-specs>...]``
    Lists installed packages.

``dnf [options] list available [<package-specs>...]``
    Lists available packages.

``dnf [options] list extras [<package-specs>...]``
    Lists extras, that is packages installed on the system that are not
    available in any known repository.

``dnf [options] list obsoletes [<package-specs>...]``
    List the packages installed on the system that are obsoleted by packages in
    any known repository.

-----------------
Makecache Command
-----------------
``dnf [options] makecache``
    Downloads and caches in binary format metadata for all known repos. Tries to
    avoid downloading whenever possible (typically when the metadata timestamp
    hasn't changed).

----------------
Provides Command
----------------
``dnf [options] provides <provide-spec>``
    Finds the packages providing the given ``<provide-spec>``. This is useful
    when one knows a filename and wants to find what package (installed or not)
    provides this file.

----------------
Repolist Command
----------------
``dnf [options] repolist [enabled|disabled|all]``
    Depending on the exact command, lists enabled, disabled or all known
    repositories. Lists all enabled repositories by default. Provides more
    detailed information when ``-v`` option is used.

--------------
Search Command
--------------
``dnf [options] search [all] <keywords>...``
    Search package metadata for the keywords. Keywords are matched as
    case-sensitive substrings, globbing is supported. By default the command
    will only look at package names and summaries, failing that (or whenever
    ``all`` was givin as an argument) it will match against package descriptions
    and URLs. The result is sorted from the most relevant results to the least.

--------------
Update Command
--------------
    Deprecated alias for the :ref:`\upgrade_command-label`.

.. _upgrade_command-label:

---------------
Upgrade Command
---------------
``dnf [options] upgrade``
    Updates each package to a highest version that is both available and
    resolvable.

``dnf [options] upgrade <package-specs>...``
    Updates each specified package to the latest available version. Updates
    depdendencies as necessary.

.. _specifying_packages-label:

===================
Specifying Packages
===================

Many commands take a ``<package-spec>`` parameter that selects a package for the
operation. The specification is first taken as the name of a package. If
multiple versions of the selected package exist in the repo, the most recent
version suitable for the given operation is used.  The name specification is
case-sensitive, globbing characters "``?``, ``*`` and ``[`` are allowed and
trigger shell-like glob matching.

If no package matches the name pattern, DNF tries to see if the pattern
corresponds to the ``name-[epoch:]version-release.arch`` format (also called
*NEVRA*), and applies the operation accordingly.


.. _specifying_provides-label:

===================
Specifying Provides
===================

``<provide-spec>`` in command descriptions means the command operates on
packages providing the given spec. This can currently only be a file
provide. The selection is case-sensitive and globbing is supported.
