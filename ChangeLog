2007-05-16 09:21  skvidal

	* yum/Makefile, rpmUtils/Makefile: fix from Christoph Thiel and Jan
	Matejek "The problem is that when precompiling python files, the
	compiler needs to know their "base path" which will be used in
	debug outputs (such as the backtrace). Without this patch, makefile
	sets $(PYDIR) as the base path, but $(PYDIR) isn't defined and the
	base path stays empty.	(some of our python builds apparently can't
	deal with it and use PIL's base path instead) The patch replaces
	$(PYDIR) with correct value, $(PKGDIR)."

2007-05-14 14:39  katzj

	* yum/__init__.py: don't cause repos to be set up unnecessarily
	(rh#238940)

2007-05-06 00:12  lmacken

	* yum/update_md.py: - Add title and release to metadata - Clean up
	UpdateNotice.__str__ - Remove pushcount, as it does not seem very
	useful at the moment - inline DTD updates - s/summary/title/ for
	Bugzilla and CVE's

2007-05-02 21:24  katzj

	* yum-updatesd.py, bin/yum-updatesd.py: move option parsing around
	a little so that yum-updatesd will start faster (rh#220614)

2007-05-02 19:19  jbowes

	* cli.py, shell.py, yumcommands.py, docs/yum.8: Add repolist
	command.
	
	This is just the 'repo list' yum shell command. 'repo list' now
	calls the repolist command instead.

2007-05-02 17:58  katzj

	* yum-updatesd.py: fix name error (#238685)

2007-04-29 09:51  skvidal

	* yum/yumRepo.py: 
	make sure we can set and del repoobj.urls for fastestmirrors, etc
	rh bugs: 238305 and 238276

2007-04-27 09:37  skvidal

	* ChangeLog: changelog merge - 3.1.7

2007-04-27 09:29  skvidal

	* yum.spec: 
	add dep on yum-metadata-parser for dbversion 10

2007-04-27 08:59  skvidal

	* rpmUtils/arch.py: 
	closes some obscure arch sorting issues with ppc and sparc rh bug:
	233427

2007-04-26 19:22  jbowes

	* cli.py, docs/yum.8: add --nogpgcheck command line option

2007-04-26 11:30  katzj

	* yum/rpmsack.py: reduce overhead of rpmack._search (Florian Festi)

2007-04-26 10:10  skvidal

	* yum.spec, yum/__init__.py: mark as 3.1.7

2007-04-26 10:04  jbowes

	* yum/config.py: Actually revert the metaclass config changes

2007-04-26 09:24  jbowes

	* yum/config.py: Revert config changes to use a metaclass.
	
	We need to let plugins add new class attributes to the config
	classes, and to have these new class attributes be accessable from
	subclasses.  Rather than wrangle the metaclass code to do this (if
	possible), let's just revert it.

2007-04-26 03:00  skvidal

	* cli.py: 
	clean up some cases where we output 'Setting up Repositories' when
	we really don't need to.

2007-04-26 00:00  skvidal

	* yum/plugins.py: 
	iterate plugin minor version number

2007-04-25 21:10  katzj

	* cli.py: set up progress callbacks before we od the repo setup;
	we've removed the explicit calls to doRepoSetup() and therefore
	need to ensure that we do the callback setup before we implicitly
	use doRepoSetup (and thus, call the postreposetup hook) 
	(rh#236152)

2007-04-25 18:51  skvidal

	* cli.py: setup caching at the right place in yum-cli. If the conf
	object is already done and the repos have been touched then we
	won't be able to set caching mode later. This prevents a silent
	exit if we're running as user

2007-04-25 18:23  skvidal

	* yum/yumRepo.py: debug cleanup

2007-04-25 18:12  katzj

	* yum/yumRepo.py: make repoXML a property so that we don't get it
	until we need it.  this fixes --disablerepo (rh#230851) and -C
	working offline (rh#223607)

2007-04-25 16:19  gijs

	* yum/packages.py: Fix problem with inPrcoRange which incorrectly
	takes the release of the providing package for requirements with
	flag != 'EQ' that do not specify an exact release.

2007-04-25 16:17  gijs

	* test/packagetests.py: Added two unit-tests for inPrcoRange with
	prcotype=requires This shows that for requires with flag != EQ yum
	incorrectly takes the version of the package itself for
	requirements that do not require a specific release (i.e.
	release==None)

2007-04-25 15:26  katzj

	* etc/yum-updatesd.init: nice yum-updatesd (rh#232202)

2007-04-25 15:07  katzj

	* yum-updatesd.py: default to sending email to/from just root
	(rh#221940)

2007-04-25 14:43  lmacken

	* yum/update_md.py: - Handle unicode metadata filenames - Accept
	'n-v-r' as well as ('n', 'v', 'r') in get_notice() - A couple of
	other cleanups too

2007-04-25 14:28  katzj

	* yum/: __init__.py, repos.py, sqlitesack.py, yumRepo.py: add close
	methods so that sqlite dbs get closed (Mark McLoughlin, rh#236409)

2007-04-25 14:18  katzj

	* yum/__init__.py: report what the other pid is (rh#201393)

2007-04-24 17:13  katzj

	* yum/sqlitesack.py: From Gijs Hollestelle --
	
	Now for every package we get it's requirements, provides, etc by
	performing a query like this: select provides.* from
	provides,packages where provides.pkgKey = packages.pkgKey and
	package.pkgId = 'foo'
	
	This uses two tables in a join. Because yum is already smart enough
	to know which sqlite database to query and because pkgKey's are
	unique per database we can do this without the join by doing it
	directly on the pkgKey: select provides.* from provides where
	provides.pkgKey = 'bar'

2007-04-24 17:02  katzj

	* yum/depsolve.py: From Gijs Hollestelle --
	
	I managed to trace it to the already_seen cache in depsolver.py it
	turns out that	when resolveDeps has missing requirements and
	restarts the depsolving loop the packages that caused that missing
	requirements are marked as already seen in the cache and their
	dependencies not always resolved again, this causes problems at
	least in the case of an upgrade but I can imagine that it could
	cause other problems as well.
	
	I've included a small patch to fix this, it removes all packages
	resulting in missing dependencies from the already seen cache
	before starting the next round of depsolving.

2007-04-24 16:06  skvidal

	* yum/: __init__.py, plugins.py: add a postconfig hook to the
	plugin architecture

2007-04-24 15:45  katzj

	* yum/depsolve.py: checking conflicts is good for us (rh#237599)

2007-04-20 05:58  timlau

	* yum/__init__.py: Patch to make API applications like
	yumdownloader work as non root, without beeing forced to use the
	cache.

2007-04-19 19:10  jbowes

	* yum/yumRepo.py: Lazy mirrorlist initialization via properties

2007-04-19 04:37  timlau

	* cli.py: fixed using an installroot dont work if yum.conf was
	located in /my/install/root/etc/yum.conf', only if it was located
	in /my/install/root/etc/yum/yum.conf.

2007-04-19 03:43  timlau

	* yum/depsolve.py: Add patch by James Antill, to handle the case
	where all packages has been removed by a plugin.

2007-04-18 19:38  katzj

	* yum/__init__.py: unset comps before we do the setup.	this
	ensures that we go back through and set everything back up (related
	to rh#231543)

2007-04-18 19:16  katzj

	* yum/__init__.py: fix explicit sack setup (rh#231543)

	* yum/__init__.py: fix pattern installs (rh#236950)

2007-04-18 03:13  timlau

	* utils.py: Added missing import

2007-04-17 16:54  katzj

	* yum/: depsolve.py, transactioninfo.py: fix broken api
	
	if you have your own TransactionData class, then the signature of
	getMembers() changing breaks thing substantially.  instead, just
	add a new method for the new functionality that we want in the
	depsolver that can work with subclasses too

2007-04-17 16:32  katzj

	* yum/rpmsack.py: raise error instead of printing when there's not
	a package in the rpmdb.  this makes the API the same as that of all
	the other package sacks

2007-04-17 05:25  timlau

	* yum/config.py: Fixed the baseconf write method so it: * dont
	causes a Traceback.  * booleans are saved as "0" & "1", insted of
	"yes" & "no" * Save all options read by the ConfigParser also if
	the values are default values.	* saves "option=value", insted of
	'option = value'

2007-04-13 05:43  timlau

	* yum/packages.py: fix Traceback, if other is a transaction member
	
	rhbz #232183 and others.

2007-04-11 10:13  jbowes

2007-04-08 17:29  jbowes

	* yum/sqlitesack.py: Just in case someone has an odd Requires:
	/foo/bar/ cover that too

2007-04-08 17:15  jbowes

	* yum/sqlitesack.py: Speed up searchFiles by searching for dirname
	when name is not a glob.  This takes yum install eclipse-cdt from
	33s to 13s on my machine.

2007-04-08 16:46  skvidal

	* rpmUtils/updates.py: closes rh bug:235632 make sure we consider
	noarch pkgs  when looking at things that can update noarch->x86_64
	and x86_64->noarch

2007-04-08 16:40  jbowes

2007-04-04 00:03  skvidal

	* ChangeLog: check in changelog

2007-04-04 00:03  skvidal

	* yum.spec, yum/__init__.py: mark as 3.1.6

2007-04-03 17:24  katzj

	* yum/depsolve.py: I made anaconda's tscheck callback less crappy.

2007-04-03 16:07  skvidal

	* cli.py: 
	merge up perl/perl-devel case and a bunch of other similar ones. 
	fixes rh bug: 231549 thanks to Robin Norwood for the easy
	replicator.

2007-04-03 15:53  skvidal

	* yum/__init__.py: make 'search' case insensitive

2007-04-03 13:57  skvidal

	* yum/depsolve.py: 
	don't constantly reset the tsInfo if there's nothing in it.

2007-04-03 11:18  jbowes

	* yum/sqlitecache.py: Create pkgKey index on PRCO data, as
	suggested by Florian Festi

2007-04-03 01:16  skvidal

	* yum/__init__.py: don't refer to self.pkgSack until we're positive
	it's setup, otherwise we get good and recursive in the wrong place
	- should make --enablerepo/--disablrepo work properly when combined
	with excludes

2007-04-02 12:06  skvidal

	* yum/rpmsack.py: 
	fix breakage in lookup of rpmsack - idx was being used nested in a
	for loop and overwriting itself.  fixes issue with installonlyn and
	all lookups by name

2007-04-01 21:30  jbowes

	* yum/depsolve.py: Remove _checkUpdate
	
	If a transaction member was marked as 'update', we'd run
	_checkInstall on it, then run _checkRemove on all of the packages
	that it was updating. After this, we'd then run _checkRemove on all
	transaction members marked as 'updated'. So we were running
	_checkRemove on every 'updated' package twice. Get rid of this.

2007-04-01 14:07  jbowes

	* yum/depsolve.py: Only call pkgAdded if the transaction member has
	a state

2007-04-01 13:48  jbowes

	* yum/rpmsack.py: Rpmsack _search optimization
	
	If we have the full pkgtup, then just look it up in the header
	dict.  Takes 'yum remove glibc' from 1m2s to 0m41s on my machine.

2007-04-01 10:56  jbowes

	* yum/depsolve.py: Simplify provideToPkg code

2007-04-01 10:04  jbowes

	* yum/depsolve.py: fix recent tscheck breakage

2007-03-31 20:37  katzj

	* yum/depsolve.py: From Chris Lumens (clumens AT redhat DOT com)
	
	Looking at why the anaconda dependency progress bar never moves, I
	found two small things.  First, we're never calling pkgAdded in
	_resolveDeps so the progress bar is never getting updated.  Second,
	we're never initializing the progress bar with the number of things
	to check so we don't know how big to make the increments.

2007-03-31 20:35  katzj

	* yum/depsolve.py: split up checking on package erasure into things
	from the rpmdb and things in the tsinfo.  given the lack of
	searchability with the tsinfo, we're better off just going through
	it once with the set of provides rather than looping over it for
	each provide.

2007-03-31 20:11  jbowes

	* yum/transactioninfo.py: Fix a misnamed variable in getMembers,
	and rearrange the code a bit

2007-03-30 15:47  katzj

	* yum/depsolve.py: switch back to logic we were previously using on
	removal as it handled some of the corner cases better.	but add
	checking to ensure that nothing in the tsinfo requires the provide.
	 this should fix the problem where   quux requires bar, bar is
	currently installed   remove bar, install quux in same transaction

2007-03-30 13:03  katzj

	* yum/sqlitesack.py: and re-fix handling of the filesystem package.
	 the split of the filenames gets confused with / being in
	filesystem which is what the uniq got added for originally

2007-03-30 11:32  katzj

	* yum/rpmsack.py: some speedups * don't use yield with
	_get_pkglist; we've already generated the list and   just returning
	it is faster * remove inner match() function of _search() so that
	we don't have	the overhead of a bazillion function calls.  yes,
	this is noticable.

2007-03-29 17:57  katzj

	* yum/sqlitesack.py: fix filelist/dirlist population to be correct!
	
	we've been doing sort/uniq on the filenames which makes
	(illustrative example..)  /lib
	dff|dbus-1.0/lidbus-1.so.3.2.0/libdbus-1.so.3 end up giving 
	/lib/libdbus-1.so.3 (dir)  /lib/libdbus-1.so.3.2.0 (file) 
	/lib/dbus-1.0 (file)
	
	This is clearly *not* what it's supposed to be :)

2007-03-28 12:00  katzj

	* yum-updatesd.py: make it so that we can pass back initialization
	errors to callers over the bus.  Patch from Ray Strode (halfline AT
	gmail DOT com)

2007-03-28 11:59  katzj

	* yum/plugins.py: allow YumPluginExit to have a translation domain
	set so that we can get a localized error message

2007-03-28 04:48  skvidal

	* yum/depsolve.py: 
	make it a small amount faster. searching the transaction set
	members is slow - it needs to be faster

2007-03-28 04:09  skvidal

	* yum/depsolve.py: 
	- catch the case where we remove something needed in the
	transaction - partial limited delta case

2007-03-26 00:37  skvidal

	* yum/transactioninfo.py: 
	allow getMembers() to return a package sack, optionally.

2007-03-23 03:41  skvidal

	* yum/depsolve.py: 
	just a stub - need to fill it out tomorrow to act as a simplifier
	for _checkRemove()

2007-03-21 23:11  skvidal

	* ChangeLog: 
	changelog merge

2007-03-21 23:09  skvidal

	* yum.spec, yum/__init__.py: 
	mark as 3.1.5

2007-03-21 15:02  skvidal

	* yum/depsolve.py: 
	newpoprovs as a dict, not a list

2007-03-21 02:53  skvidal

	* rpmUtils/miscutils.py: 
	somehow we trickled in a '0' in the single case where we really do
	mean ('None') for epoch - the case is when the 'version' string
	from an rpm header is '' then we should be returning (None, None,
	None) for the evr tuple not ('0', None, None)
	
	We tripped this, I think b/c maybe rpm changed from returning None
	for empty version fields to returning ''. Unsure but this appears
	to do what is expected either way.

2007-03-21 02:51  skvidal

	* yum/depsolve.py: 
	do a filelists check for each of the updated pkgs - this lets us
	prune out the lists of real problems faster at the expense of
	downloading the filelists metadata.
	
	also do a first cut of the new dep check object. This isn't wired
	up yet, but if it works it means not looking up data we already
	know and it should let us implement the delta in it.

2007-03-20 07:46  timlau

	* yum/comps.py: Make comps handle situation where comps.xml for  3.
	part repos dont contains any name and description tags for groups
	shared with the base repo, because they what to use the same name
	and description as set	in the base repo.  If the 3. part repo
	comps.xml get parsed first, then the group ends up with no name. 
	This fix solves the problem by merging the names & descriptions.

2007-03-20 06:19  timlau

	* yum/__init__.py: fixed TypeError in comps property (fset)

2007-03-19 17:53  katzj

	* yum/__init__.py: when we close the rpmdb, we need to also ensure
	that the repos don't think they're represented in the comps object
	anymore (rh#230877 and others)

2007-03-19 16:29  katzj

	* yum/depsolve.py: remove the busted attempt at depsolving since it
	keeps throwing off my searches

2007-03-19 16:21  katzj

	* yum/: __init__.py, depsolve.py: export the isPackageInstalled
	method and just use the one from __init__ instead of copies
	everywhere.  remove the one from the depsolver which is subtly
	different (and breaks for the fresh install case)

2007-03-19 15:34  katzj

	* yum-updatesd.py: Fixes GetUpdateInfo() barfing with
	dbus-python-0.80 or later.
	
	From Bill Nottingham

2007-03-19 06:43  timlau

	* yum/__init__.py: make doRepoSetup (__getRepos) only add the repos
	once.  So dont get 'Repository xxxx is listed more than once in the
	configuration' in yum api programs like yum-utils, yumex etc,
	calling doRepoSetup() because self.repos has been accessed before.

2007-03-18 22:37  katzj

	* rpmUtils/arch.py: canonArch of rpmUtils.arch isn't used
	everywhere it could be, making it less useful.	use it more.  patch
	from Bill Nottingham

2007-03-18 22:31  katzj

	* yum/depsolve.py: we shouldn't ignore config() deps -- it was
	reasonable to do so in the closed universe of anaconda, but not so
	much here.

2007-03-16 13:36  skvidal

	* yum/__init__.py: 
	don't print time.time() when doing glob'd 'provides' searches

2007-03-09 12:05  jbowes

	* yum/sqlitesack.py: Use a user-defined function for searchfiles

2007-03-07 17:07  katzj

	* shell.py: nuke no-longer existent and dead method call
	(rh#231202)

	* ChangeLog: 
	check in changelog

2007-03-07 14:08  skvidal

	* yum.spec, yum/__init__.py: 
	mark as 3.1.4

2007-03-05 17:26  katzj

	* yum/yumRepo.py: YumRepository.__get -> YumRepository._getFile. 
	and a placeholder compat stub although I don't know how it could be
	used in reality

2007-03-05 14:39  katzj

	* yum/config.py: define _reposlist in the YumConf object. 
	otherwise, we break API for callers who override config setup

2007-03-05 09:04  jbowes

	* yum/sqlitesack.py: Uniq the search results, and use a variable
	for 'glob' or '=' in the sql queries

2007-03-05 08:02  jbowes

	* yum/sqlitesack.py: Fix traceback in filelist search

2007-03-04 23:41  skvidal

	* yum/depsolve.py: 
	make sure we look at the provides in the txmbr from packages which
	aren't in any packagesack at all (localinstalls)

2007-03-04 22:54  skvidal

	* yum/sqlitesack.py: 
	optimize a couple of returns from changelog and filelist dumps

2007-03-04 22:51  skvidal

	* yum/: __init__.py, sqlitesack.py: 
	clean up the 'yum provides' command by fixing searchALL,
	implementing searchFiles() properly and by jbowes showing me how
	sqlite is stupid with the ordering of the tables you're selecting
	from.

2007-03-04 16:45  skvidal

	* yum/packageSack.py: 
	optimize delPackage() in MetaSack even though it seems like it is a
	performance hit in every situation

2007-03-04 16:37  skvidal

	* yum/__init__.py: 
	remove same issue with includePackages()

2007-03-04 16:34  skvidal

	* yum/: __init__.py, packageSack.py, sqlitesack.py: 
	kill performance hit on excludePackage() call by not referencing
	the same information 4 times for no apparent reason.

2007-03-04 13:48  jbowes

	* yum/: __init__.py, sqlitesack.py: For the yum provides command,
	don't return packages by dep first, as this is covered by searchAll
	(with the addition of /bin etc file search). Also, unique the
	results from searchAll.

2007-03-04 11:32  jbowes

	* yum/: sqlitecache.py, sqlitesack.py: Iterate over the cursor
	instead of using fetchall

2007-03-04 10:43  skvidal

	* yum/__init__.py: 
	get all the cases where we need to read in the filelist info in
	doSackFilelistPopulate()

2007-03-04 10:37  skvidal

	* yum/__init__.py: 
	fix merge conflict

2007-03-04 10:36  skvidal

	* yum/: sqlitesack.py, sqlutils.py: 
	- implement not-quite-complete searchFiles() method to the
	sqlitesack - add a couple of commented-out debug statements so I
	don't have to constantly add and delete them to sqlutils

2007-03-04 09:34  jbowes

	* yum/sqlitesack.py: Partial fix for 'yum provides' results. Still
	not getting as many hits as 3.0.3 however.

2007-03-03 20:36  jbowes

	* yum/__init__.py: Fix a block's indentation level

2007-03-03 13:58  jbowes

	* yum/sqlitesack.py: Fix an improperly indented block

2007-03-02 16:19  katzj

	* yum/__init__.py: if someone calls doRepoSetup(), then they're
	expecting to go through the full setup.  perhaps due to specifying
	a repo or something along those lines.	so make it so that we can
	do that

2007-03-02 16:08  katzj

	* yum/__init__.py: fix callers of doRepoSetup as well

2007-03-02 16:03  katzj

	* yum/__init__.py: fix a typo.	and switch to fdel setting things
	to None so that we don't get tracebacks from it

2007-03-02 15:58  katzj

	* yum/__init__.py: actually, do generic setattr and delattr on all
	of these so we don't have to get a bug filed on each

2007-03-02 15:49  katzj

	* yum/__init__.py: allow setting pkgSack (rh#230734)

2007-03-02 15:39  katzj

	* yum/sqlitesack.py: need to reset the pkglist when excluding
	packages.  otherwise, we end up with excluded packages in the
	package list (rh#230771)

2007-03-02 15:27  jbowes

	* yum/config.py: get iteritems to do what its supposed to - return
	the value, not the option object

2007-03-02 14:18  katzj

	* yum/sqlitesack.py: * convert pkgids to be str type instead of
	unicode.  * can't do qmark substitution with "where foo in ?"
	expressions.  at least,   I can't figure out how to make them work.

2007-03-02 09:11  skvidal

	* yum/__init__.py: 
	correct API break in doSackSetup()

2007-03-01 16:08  katzj

	* yum/depsolve.py: don't do the tsInfoDelta optimization.  with it,
	if we have a missing dep on the first time through the loop and
	don't resolve it, we don't ever go back to see if it's resolved. 
	this breaks updating on a repo with broken deps

2007-03-01 14:17  skvidal

	* ChangeLog: 
	update changelog

2007-03-01 14:16  skvidal

	* yum/packageSack.py: 
	note about a fixme

2007-02-28 21:53  skvidal

	* yum/__init__.py: 
	make sure anything about the repo has been setup before we see if
	the filelists are imported

2007-02-28 18:01  katzj

	* yum/depsolve.py: make sure we actually have something to set as a
	dep.  fixes traceback found by jon corbet

2007-02-28 17:49  jbowes

	* yum/sqlitesack.py: Fixing a sql query for python 2.5. I'll just
	assume it still works on older pythons

2007-02-28 14:06  katzj

	* yum/depsolve.py: check to ensure that things being removed aren't
	still satisfied by the rpmdb (rh#230392)

2007-02-28 14:03  skvidal

	* yum/yumRepo.py: 
	grudgingly check the just-unzipped sqlite file.

2007-02-28 11:22  skvidal

	* yum/yumRepo.py: 
	delete the bz2 file after we uncompress it.

2007-02-28 10:46  skvidal

	* yum/yumRepo.py: 
	with clean cache, make sure you bunzip the sqlite file :)

2007-02-28 10:26  katzj

	* yum/sqlitesack.py: fix to work with either sqlite API

2007-02-28 10:13  jbowes

	* yum/__init__.py: During yum search, only output the package name,
	ver, etc once per match

2007-02-28 08:00  skvidal

	* yum/sqlitesack.py: 
	- fix traceback found by Tim - kill of the last of the db2class
	calls

2007-02-28 07:53  timlau

	* yum/packages.py: Added patch by Jack Neely to fix traceback when
	the following is used.
	
	if po == None:
	
	(rhbz #229917)

2007-02-28 02:19  skvidal

	* yum/sqlitesack.py: 
	- make excludes work again - add _excluded() method to check if a
	package in a repo is excluded

2007-02-28 01:49  skvidal

	* yum/sqlitesack.py: 
	check excludeArch query to use not in (range)

2007-02-28 00:46  skvidal

	* yum/sqlitesack.py: 
	- condense down some more code - get rid of the need for db2class()

2007-02-27 22:53  skvidal

	* yum/sqlitesack.py: 
	get rid of some unused imports

2007-02-27 21:26  skvidal

	* yum/sqlitesack.py: 
	looks like we get the same benefit of not calling __init__() on
	each of the objects as we do by flattening the class. So don't
	flatten them.

2007-02-27 20:50  jbowes

	* yum/config.py: Use dark metaclass magic to reduce the number of
	times we have to examine the attributes of config stuff. Before we
	did it per instance, now it is per class.

2007-02-27 17:18  skvidal

	* yum/rpmsack.py: 
	minor change as to how to check for header_dict being empty

2007-02-27 17:17  skvidal

	* yum/sqlitesack.py: 
	- flatten down the YumAvailablePackageSqlite object by porting
	methods from YumAvailablePackage.  - misc code clean ups - more to
	go

2007-02-27 14:18  skvidal

	* yum/yumRepo.py: 
	make sure xml-based repos work, too.

2007-02-27 00:32  skvidal

	* yum/__init__.py: 
	- small speed improvements to doPackageLists() - some minor changes
	to _getSacks()

2007-02-27 00:27  skvidal

	* yum/yumRepo.py: 
	- get rid of a bunch of duplicated code - make it so we don't
	bunzip the sqlite.bz file everytime for no good reason - add an
	openchecksum optional argument to repo.checkMD()

2007-02-26 13:07  skvidal

	* yum/sqlitesack.py: 
	- condense a couple of select statements - add statement to return
	multiple pkgs from pkgid's at once.  - add some checks in to keep
	from tracing back when people reset the package sacks in odd ways
	(thanks to Jesse for showing me this)

2007-02-26 01:35  skvidal

	* yum/sqlitesack.py: 
	combine the selects into a single statement.

2007-02-24 03:05  skvidal

	* yum/sqlitesack.py: 
	make install/remove/update globs work again :)

2007-02-23 11:10  skvidal

	* yum/sqlitesack.py: 
	collapse the searchPrco select into a single select combining
	packages and the prco table. Speeds up returns of big items.

2007-02-23 02:30  skvidal

	* yum/__init__.py: 
	fixme to remember

2007-02-23 02:26  skvidal

	* yum/sqlitesack.py: 
	keep from tripping over an empty list

2007-02-23 00:52  skvidal

	* yum/: __init__.py, constants.py, sqlitesack.py: 
	Take a hammer to the search function based on suggestions by
	Patrick Reynolds.

2007-02-22 17:43  skvidal

	* shell.py, utils.py, yum/plugins.py: 
	more deprecation clean ups.

2007-02-22 15:46  skvidal

	* yum/__init__.py: 
	more deprecation warning clean ups

2007-02-22 15:36  skvidal

	* cli.py, yum/depsolve.py: 
	clean up some deprecated methods

2007-02-22 15:03  skvidal

	* yum/: __init__.py, depsolve.py: fix all the deprecation warnings
	to be future warnings

2007-02-22 14:57  skvidal

	* yum/: __init__.py, depsolve.py: 
	implement the rest of the properties, rename all the methods, add
	deprecation warnings to the old method names.

2007-02-21 22:47  skvidal

	* cli.py, yum/__init__.py, yum/depsolve.py, yum/transactioninfo.py:
	
	yum-with-properties patch. This makes yum use properties for most
	of the base attributes of YumBase so that setup is less necessary
	for default operation. This is half way through the changes.

2007-02-21 13:21  katzj

	* yum/__init__.py: don't complain about being unable to remove
	headers that may not exist

2007-02-21 11:36  katzj

	* yum/sqlitesack.py: we need to take excludes into account with
	matchPackageNames()

2007-02-20 23:38  skvidal

	* ChangeLog: 
	checkin changelog

2007-02-20 12:04  katzj

	* yum/depsolve.py: add a teensy bit more logging so that things
	aren't as silent

2007-02-20 11:30  katzj

	* yum/depsolve.py: make sure the sack is setup. ugh.

2007-02-20 11:16  katzj

	* yum/depsolve.py: decrease the likelihood that we have to grab the
	filelists

2007-02-19 23:45  katzj

	* yum/depsolve.py: simple optimization for the update case --
	
	if updated foo-1 provided /usr/bin/foo and foo-2 still provides
	/usr/bin/foo, then there's no need to care about the erasure case
	of /usr/bin/foo; it'll still be covered.  similarly for identical
	requires
	
	and remove the bits seth commented out, they're dead dead dead now.

2007-02-19 17:56  katzj

	* yum/depsolve.py: got a little bit too carried away cleaning up
	unrelated changes

2007-02-19 17:51  katzj

	* yum/depsolve.py: this doesn't really belong here, but make it so
	that we see that installonly packages are being installed and not
	updated.  otherwise, it's not reflected until you actually do the
	install/update breaking plugins (installonlyn) and the display of
	what's being done
	
	possibly move to __init__.py:buildTransaction() after the
	resolveDeps()  ???

2007-02-19 17:48  katzj

	* yum/: constants.py, depsolve.py: fixes to pass my current testing
	set * ensure that we add the updated package relation when doing an
	addUpdate() * significantly rework the removal case.  the basic
	idea is   for all provides being removed     for everything that
	requires the provide (by name)	     make sure we're not already
	removing the package	   ensure the removed package _actually_
	was a satisfier       see what's installed that provides the same
	name	     if it's being removed, ignore it	      see if it
	satisfies our require; if so, this package is ok       do the same
	checks with packages being installed to find out if we're ok	  
	if we're not okay, then we need to fulfill a dep for prov

2007-02-19 17:40  katzj

	* yum/transactioninfo.py: allow getting tsinfo members that are
	just in a specific state.  this is a bit ugly right now

2007-02-19 17:36  katzj

	* yum/sqlitesack.py: * now that we have provides as a property,
	they get filled in when   requested and we don't have to prefill
	with the prco we searched for.	  filling it in means that we don't
	get it from the sqlitedb for full results
	
	* the LIKE sqlite query seems to not work, disable it for now

2007-02-19 17:35  katzj

	* yum/packages.py: if a package requires foo-version without a
	release, we need to match that as being satisfied with a provide of
	foo-version-*.
	
	eg,   glest-data requires glest = 2.0.0   glest provides glest =
	2.0.0-5.fc7

2007-02-19 13:39  jbowes

	* yum/packages.py: silly jeremy, i'd *never* break the api. revert
	previous change to returnHeaderFromPackage, since its a new method

2007-02-19 11:48  katzj

	* yum/packages.py: * simplify checkPrco slightly * don't break API
	gratuitously with po.returnHeaderFromPackage()

2007-02-18 19:49  jbowes

	* yum/packages.py: _populatePrco is called often. use map() to
	speed things up a bit.

2007-02-18 19:47  jbowes

	* yum/depsolve.py: Let the logger do the string substitution, so we
	don't have to call __str__ on packages unless we're actually
	printing

2007-02-18 16:58  jbowes

	* yum/depsolve.py: Speed up erase by only doing tscheck on the new
	editions to tsInfo, rather than doing the old ones over and over
	again

2007-02-18 09:30  jbowes

	* yum/depsolve.py, yum/packages.py, rpmUtils/miscutils.py: When
	loading the header for transaction checking, don't check the
	signature.
	
	rpm will raise an exception when we try to read the header from an
	fdno, if we have signature checking turned on and the header's
	signature is bad or unknown. At the stage that we're reading the
	header, we don't care and just want to get that data.

2007-02-17 18:16  jbowes

	* yum/rpmsack.py: Store hdr and idx in header_dict, to reduce the
	calls to header_from_index.  Also use header_dict's pkgtups for
	_get_pkglist.
	
	Testing on my laptop shows depsolving for 'install kdelibs' to go
	from 7s to 5s, which is on par with old dep solving, with all
	headers on disk.

2007-02-16 23:03  jbowes

	* test/packagetests.py: Add some buildPkgDictRef tests

2007-02-16 19:00  jbowes

	* docs/yum.conf.5, yum/config.py: Search for plugins in /usr/share
	and /usr/lib

2007-02-16 17:22  jbowes

	* test/packagetests.py: Add PackageEVR tests

2007-02-16 16:46  jbowes

	* test/packagetests.py: Use setUp and remove a bunch of duplication

2007-02-16 13:48  jbowes

	* test/packagetests.py: add more inPrcoRange tests

2007-02-16 02:58  timlau

	* cli.py: Let the plugins know what the commandline options and
	arguments are.

2007-02-16 01:06  skvidal

	* yum/: constants.py, depsolve.py, transactioninfo.py: 
	all of this may need to be rolled back but:
	
	-  add an 'updated' txmbr for tsInfo so we can easily see what's
	being	removed, implicitly as part of an update - make
	_checkUpdate() in YumDepsolver be an amalgam of install and remove
	- add the TS_UPDATED constant to constants

2007-02-15 19:00  jbowes

	* test/packagetests.py, yum/packages.py: Add more inPrcoRange
	tests, plus fix a bug

2007-02-15 12:28  jbowes

	* Makefile: add a 'test' makefile target

2007-02-15 12:18  jbowes

	* test/: alltests.py, packagetests.py, settestpath.py: add test dir
	for unit tests, with sample inPrcoRange test

2007-02-15 05:03  skvidal

	* yum/: depsolve.py, packages.py: 
	fix checkRemove and flesh out inPrcoRange() to be fairly complete

2007-02-15 00:48  skvidal

	* yum/depsolve.py: import os.path

2007-02-14 17:08  katzj

	* yum/depsolve.py, cli.py, yum-updatesd.py: make it so that we see
	that the local rpm is present and then don't download rather than
	requiring API callers to specify what to do

2007-02-14 16:35  skvidal

	* yum.spec, yum/__init__.py: 
	3.1.2 mark

2007-02-14 15:41  skvidal

	* cli.py, yum-updatesd.py, yum/depsolve.py, yum/packages.py: remove
	the need for .hdr files for the transaction run.  - add 'noheaders'
	option to DepSolve.populateTs(). Defaults to False for	 backward
	api compat. When True it will not attempt to retrieve the .hdr	
	via byteranges but will read it out of the rpm
	
	add

2007-02-14 13:20  jbowes

	* yum/depsolve.py: Use a boolean for CheckDeps rather than an int

2007-02-14 12:43  katzj

	* yum/packages.py: fix the traceback terje hit

2007-02-14 12:10  katzj

	* yum/: __init__.py, depsolve.py: headerless dep solving, take 3
	now we have a method to return the same sort of stuff as rpm's
	ts.check(), this makes it so that we can continue to use all of the
	handling we've had thus far for finding what to update, etc instead
	of having to reinvent all of those wheels.  switch over to using
	this.

2007-02-14 12:07  katzj

	* yum/misc.py: split out conversion of version tuple -> string, use
	it

2007-02-14 11:03  katzj

	* rpmUtils/miscutils.py: epoch value should always be a string

2007-02-13 15:00  pmatilai

	* yum/packages.py: - return changelog data from rpm headers in the
	same (date, author, message)   order as elsewhere (rhbz#221166)

2007-02-13 10:22  jbowes

	* yum/depsolve.py: Add a fixme for a case when we should fail.
	Maybe I'll get to it later, but anyone else is welcome to it

2007-02-12 17:46  katzj

	* yum/depsolve.py: make removes fast too.

2007-02-12 17:16  katzj

	* yum/packages.py: whitespace so there's a commit message for
	this...  * if there's not a sha1header in the package (ie, it was
	built with old old rpm)   then we should still have _something_ for
	the pkgid.  use the md5 for now

2007-02-12 17:14  katzj

	* yum/: __init__.py, packages.py, yumRepo.py: * switch back to
	using AnacondaDepsolver by default
	
	media fixes: * remove the media placeholder at this point * sort
	downloading based on discid to avoid ping pong-ing between discs *
	handle getting the discnum from the package * default disc to 1,
	not None

2007-02-12 17:01  katzj

	* yum/: depsolve.py, rpmsack.py: further work on in-yum depsolver *
	handle packages which are already installed and solve deps for new
	packages * handle packages being removed including file bits * add
	whatRequires method for the rpmdb * split things up a little
	
	note that removals are currently very slow.

2007-02-07 01:48  skvidal

	* yum/: constants.py, repoMDObject.py, sqlitecache.py, yumRepo.py: 
	check dbversion before downloading sqlite dbs move dbversion into
	constants

2007-02-07 01:06  skvidal

	* ChangeLog: more changelog updates

2007-02-07 01:05  skvidal

	* cli.py: 
	fix yum deplist to work with new matchPackageNames method

2007-02-07 00:20  skvidal

	* ChangeLog: check in changelog

2007-02-06 10:13  timlau

	* utils.py: Added missing yum.plugins import

2007-02-06 10:08  timlau

	* cli.py, utils.py: - Changes to yum's getOptionConfig and
	YumOption parser to make them	    reuseable in future yum-util
	tools.	- Added utils.py with baseclass for future yum-utils.

2007-02-06 01:10  skvidal

	* yum.spec, yum/__init__.py: 
	3.1.1 labels in source and spec

2007-02-05 09:38  jbowes

	* yum/__init__.py: use the old depsolver for now, since the new one
	will like, not work.

2007-02-04 13:25  skvidal

	* yum/yumRepo.py: 
	make user execution from db-based-cache work

2007-02-04 13:23  katzj

	* yum/yumRepo.py: further support for media installs.  determine
	the discid, don't do the url bits for scheme == media (this may
	also work for yum 3.0.x to handle the dvd being mounted for your
	core baseurl), and pass a few more bits
	
	NOTE: the arguments for the media grabber function are not at all
	set in stone right now and will change as pirut/anaconda actually
	use this.

2007-02-04 12:32  jbowes

	* yum/: __init__.py, depsolve.py: Add anaconda's no-headers

2007-02-03 16:30  katzj

	* yum/: Errors.py, __init__.py, config.py, yumRepo.py: start of
	pushing media handling into yum.  define mediaid= in a repo config
	file to say that a specific repo is tied to a specific media set. 
	yum api users need to set self.mediagrabber in their YumBase object
	to a function that actually does the getting of the file.

	another patch for logging

2007-02-03 10:44  katzj

	* yum/: __init__.py, transactioninfo.py: make conditionals not a
	subclass since we really don't want to have to deal with that in
	the inheritance chain.	also, it doesn't really make any difference
	since we only add to conditionals if the config option is set

2007-02-03 10:37  katzj

	* yum/: __init__.py, packages.py: * filter FutureWarnings * mark
	some things as deprecation warnings

	like the one on YumPackageSack
	
	SqlitePackageSack used to store 'metadata' in added as 'primary',
	and only kept the last type in added. Now it stores 'metadata' as
	'metadata', and appends to added.

2006-12-09 20:47  jbowes

	* rpmUtils/miscutils.py: Just use str() it's faster and does the
	same thing.

2006-12-09 18:38  jbowes

	* yum/sqlitesack.py: Fix typo in some sqlitesack methods

2006-12-09 09:02  jbowes

2006-12-08 20:35  jbowes

	fix up the debuglevel and errorlevel so they are set appropriately
	from the cmdline to the conf

2006-12-05 15:57  katzj

	* yum/mdparser.py: jbowes (rightfully) points out that this can be
	even simpler

2006-12-05 15:54  katzj

	* yum/: sqlitecache.py, sqlitesack.py: support newer versions of
	pysqlite as included in python 2.5 and standalone
	
	the bulk of this is:  a) converting to use qmark instead of
	pyformat for queries	 (http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/
	for DB-API info)  b) doing on-the-fly conversion to pyformat if
	we're still using old	  pysqlite.
	
	since with this version of yum, I'd expect most people to move to
	new python or at least new pysqlite, things are done in the
	direction that's faster for the new stuff.
	
	if we decide to require python2.5 or pysqlite 2.x for yum 3.2, then
	this can be simplified a bit

2006-12-05 15:51  katzj

	* yum/sqlutils.py: utility functions to handle differences in
	pysqlite versions These are from Wichert Akkerman
	<wichert@deephackmode.org>'s python-dhm    
	http://www.wiggy.net/code/python-dhm

2006-12-05 15:45  katzj

	* yum/: comps.py, repoMDObject.py: for python2.5, cElementTree is
	now xml.etree; use it

2006-12-05 15:42  katzj

	* yum/mdparser.py: removing this chunk breaks things if you're not
	using yum-metadata-parser, but at least make it more readable

2006-12-05 15:36  katzj

	* yum/Errors.py: Yum errors take a single value and not a tuple of
	arguments since the value is a string -- change to reflect that so
	that we don't get "interesting" error messages with python2.5

2006-12-04 19:40  jbowes

	* callback.py, cli.py, output.py, progress_meter.py, shell.py,
	yum-updatesd.py, bin/yum-updatesd.py, bin/yum.py, yum/comps.py,

	yum/packageSack.py, yum/packages.py, yum/pgpmsg.py,
	yum/sqlitecache.py, yum/update_md.py, rpmUtils/miscutils.py,
	rpmUtils/updates.py: pychecker related fixes, including unused
	imports, and removal of use of deprecated methods from the string
	module

2006-12-03 10:55  jbowes

	* yum/packageSack.py: Re-enable using sack.searchAll in the
	provides command. This really speeds up things, since we'll pull
	fewer filelists for packages out of the db. Looks like this broke
	when the metasack was introduced. oops. ;)

2006-11-30 21:46  jbowes

	* yum/yumRepo.py: Remove unused code for manipulating the
	failure_obj during __get

2006-10-12 13:58  skvidal

	* yum/rpmsack.py: 
	- speed up searchNevra() by building a pkgtup->headerindex dict -
	make the header_from_index() method work by deleting match iterator
	each time explicitly. Thanks to Jay  Soffian for finding this.

2006-10-10 22:32  katzj

	* yum/__init__.py: raise the right error... this ended up
	manifesting itself by raising the last error (which had been passed
	on) instead of the intended and an entirely non-obvious traceback. 
	moral of the story: always raise a specific exception
	
	(rh#210135)

2006-10-05 22:24  katzj

	* yum/yumRepo.py: fix basepath handling (from Dennis Gregorivic)

	- 3.0 mark - make python 2.4 a req in yum.spec

2006-10-03 17:43  skvidal

	* yum/depsolve.py: 
	messing around with a few tests to figure out where it is slow.

2006-10-03 01:48  skvidal

	* shell.py, yum/depsolve.py: 
	make the fix for pekka's bug more correct

2006-10-03 01:41  skvidal

	ConfigPreProcessor/ConfigParser in plugins, so i works like the

2006-10-02 10:42  katzj

	* yum/packages.py: * add a remote_url property for packages to get
	the remote location as a   string that can be printed * get rid of
	some explicit uses of relativepath

2006-10-02 09:02  mjs

	* yum/config.py: Copy the default value in case it is mutable and
	different config instances end up manipulating the same default
	value.

2006-10-02 04:42  timlau

	* yum/plugins.py: fix for this error : AttributeError: 'module'
	object has no attribute 'IncludingConfigParser' When running latest
	yum-cvs with plugins.

2006-10-01 23:46  skvidal

	* yum/: __init__.py, config.py, parser.py: 
	make the include= and yum -c http://path/to/file behave like I
	thought they should.
	
	This, ultimately, removes the need for parser.IncludingConfigParser
	and parser.IncludedConfigParser but I haven't removed them yet b/c
	I wanted to verify that they are not used elsewhere, first.

2006-09-29 11:44  mjs

	* yum/config.py: put accidentally removed line back

2006-09-29 11:42  mjs

	discussed on yum-devel

2006-09-29 11:30  mjs

	* yum/config.py: Removed on the fly write-back support from the

	out

2006-09-29 00:40  skvidal

	* yum/packageSack.py: 
	make sure we're only returning the newest from the metasack

2006-09-28 18:22  katzj

	* yum/__init__.py: if we have a local copy of the package that
	checksums fine, use it instead of trying to do a range request from
	the end of the file (rh#208460)208460)208460)208460)

2006-09-28 16:23  katzj

	headers by index bump version

2006-09-26 09:24  mjs

	* cli.py, shell.py, yumcommands.py, yum/plugins.py: Committed
	Bastiaan Bakker's command extension patch. I made a few bug fixes

	string.lower("I") != "i" (rh#206853)

	config dumping.

2006-09-13 18:39  katzj

	* yum-updatesd.py: * actually time out after a few tries * catch
	another place we could potentially not unlock the pid file

2006-09-13 18:37  katzj

	* yum/: packages.py, sqlitesack.py: swap arguments on __init__ for
	a few Package types so that we have consistency

2006-09-13 18:19  katzj

	* yum/__init__.py: clean up some duplicate code to take advantage
	of the fact that the rpmdb is now a package sack

2006-09-11 17:46  katzj

	* yum/yumRepo.py: we need to redo setupGrab() after changing
	callbacks so that our grabber has the right info.  this makes it so
	that we get progress feedback when downloading in pirut again

2006-09-11 17:01  katzj

	* cli.py, yum/__init__.py: fix whatprovides based on a patch from
	Tim Lauridsen (rh#205924)

2006-09-11 14:09  mjs

	* yum/rpmsack.py: makePackageObject -> _makePackageObject

2006-09-11 06:12  mjs

	* yum/__init__.py: Fixed the disk space check; it was failing
	because po.size can be a string.  Make the disk space check more
	readable by using the statvfs attributes.

2006-09-11 05:56  mjs

	* yum/__init__.py: Prevent a KeyError that was occur during the
	disk space check because errors wasn't always initialised
	correctly. Added adderror() to avoid initialisation problems like
	this and minimise clutter.

2006-09-08 17:05  skvidal

	* yum/: __init__.py, packages.py: 
	partial check in just to get it off my laptop:
	
	1. do check for space in cache dir for downloading packages 2.
	start changing around the way packages are checked

2006-09-08 13:06  skvidal

	* yum/: __init__.py, packages.py: 
	get rid of silly code in verifyPkg()

2006-09-08 12:52  skvidal

	* yum/rpmsack.py: 
	as I read through the changes:	- clean up one docstring  - make
	some of the list constructions using _search look the same

2006-09-08 12:38  skvidal

	* yum/rpmsack.py: 
	make getNameArchPkgList() and getNamePkgList() consistent - if our
	pkglist is length zero then they would have traced back.

2006-09-08 12:29  mjs

	* yum/rpmsack.py: update comments

2006-09-08 12:21  skvidal

	* yum/: __init__.py, misc.py, packages.py: 
	- move refineSearchPattern into  misc from YumBase - clean up some
	pychecker errors

2006-09-08 12:07  mjs

	* yum/rpmsack.py: Big cleanup of RPMDBPackageSack. Indexes are no
	longer built (buildIndexes).  This significantly reducing Yum's
	initialisation time and reduces memory footprint. Despite the lack
	of indexes almost all operations are faster. Will post stats to
	yum-devel.

2006-09-08 09:32  skvidal

	* cli.py, output.py, yum/__init__.py, yum/misc.py, yum/packages.py:
	
	- fix up findDeps interface - it now takes a list of package
	objects - clean up a deprecation in deplistoutput - remove
	RpmBase._prcoTuple2Printable() since it was no longer needed and
	only introduced in this devel series.

2006-09-06 08:57  katzj

	* cli.py: more obvious error message for group not existing
	(rh#204878)

2006-09-06 03:58  mjs

	* cli.py: remove a bunch of unused imports

2006-09-06 03:48  mjs

2006-09-06 00:18  skvidal

	* ChangeLog: 
	check in changelog

2006-09-06 00:17  skvidal

	* yum.spec, yum/__init__.py: 
	mark as 2.9.6

2006-09-05 22:21  katzj

	* cli.py: initialize "interface" plugins for the cli (patch from
	panu)

2006-09-05 22:19  katzj

	* yum-updatesd.py: fix up logging

2006-09-05 14:42  pmatilai

	* yum/depsolve.py: - set transaction problem filters according to
	what's specified in   tsInfo.problemFilter list

2006-09-05 13:57  pmatilai

	* yum/plugins.py: - dont traceback trying to call nonexistent log()
	method if plugin   configuration not found

2006-09-05 13:37  katzj

	* yum/packageSack.py: mo' bettah deprecation warnings

2006-09-05 13:36  katzj

	* yum/__init__.py: fix deprecation warning

2006-09-05 10:03  skvidal

	* yum/__init__.py: 
	make output about key importing work

2006-09-04 12:33  mjs

	* cli.py, shell.py, yum-updatesd.py, yum/__init__.py,
	yum/depsolve.py: Clean up the attributes of YumBase so that they
	are always defined. They are None when not initialised and set if
	initialised. No more messing around with hasattr and deinitialising
	in now a matter of "self.foo = None".

2006-09-03 17:56  skvidal

	* yum/yumRepo.py: 
	set the default interrupt_callback to None for the folks operating
	in lazy-mode

2006-09-03 17:34  mjs

	* output.py, yum/repos.py, yum/yumRepo.py: Allow the interrupt
	callback to be set via the API. Push the command line Yum's own
	interrupt callback function out of the API code.

2006-09-03 17:11  mjs

	* cli.py, yum/__init__.py, yum/rpmsack.py, yum/yumRepo.py,
	rpmUtils/transaction.py: Fixes so that CTRL-C finally works
	properly:     - rpmdb transactions are only kept open when strictly
	necessary so that	SIGINT handler is left alone by rpm during
	downloads etc	  - added a simple interrupt_callback for package
	downloads. A single CTRL-C	 will push the download to the next
	mirror. Two quick CTRL-C's will       terminate Yum. This needs
	cleaning up to not upset Yum API clients.

2006-09-03 06:21  mjs

	* yum/__init__.py: fix a return that should be a raise

2006-09-03 05:24  mjs

	* yum/misc.py: removed unnecessary import

2006-09-02 22:50  skvidal

	* yum/rpmsack.py: 
	make sure every package object returned from the rpmsack has an idx
	attribute

2006-09-02 19:17  skvidal

	* yum/depsolve.py: 
	that addErase is to the ts, not tsInfo so it needs a header or an
	header index - not a po.

2006-09-02 18:59  katzj

	* yum/depsolve.py: fix for API change

2006-09-02 18:58  katzj

	* yum/packages.py: add back getProvidesNames() as deprecated, spew
	a deprecation warning for prcoPrintable() as well

2006-09-02 03:47  skvidal

	* yum/: __init__.py, depsolve.py, packages.py, repos.py,
	rpmsack.py, sqlitesack.py, yumRepo.py: 
	- add a repository object to each package object.  - fix a small
	bug in depsolving when the requires and the provides don't match up
	with 0-epoch use - add prco's_print properties to all package
	objects - make it so filelists are autoloaded, if possible, when
	querying filelists of YumAvailablePackageSqlite

2006-09-02 01:45  skvidal

	* yum/: depsolve.py, packages.py, sqlitesack.py: 
	clean up some of the dealing with package objects setup:
	po.provides po.requires po.obsoletes po.conflicts po.provides_names
	po.requires_names po.obsoletes_names po.conflicts_names
	po.changelog po.filelist po.dirlist po.ghostlist po.checksums
	po.changelog
	
	all as properties. They call out when needed so we shouldn't need
	to setup anything to go get them.

2006-09-01 21:16  skvidal

	* yum/: packages.py, sqlitesack.py: 
	- properties do not behave like other subclassable items - which
	sucks - add filelists, dirlists and ghostlist property attributes
	to all package objects

2006-09-01 15:00  skvidal

	* cli.py, yum/depsolve.py, yum/rpmsack.py: 
	added our rpmdb index into package objects from the rpmdb.
	
	po.idx
	
	gets rid of last returnIndexesByTuple()

2006-08-31 22:04  katzj

	* yum/__init__.py: only initialize core plugins by default as
	discussed on yum-devel

2006-08-31 01:11  skvidal

	* yum/sqlitesack.py: 
	cleaning up the things we're suddenly not importing - this makes
	checksums work and maybe prcos

2006-08-30 15:48  katzj

	* yum/__init__.py: fix logging setup to pass debug and error in the
	right order.  fixes yum -d6 and other similar things

2006-08-30 12:49  skvidal

	* yum/depsolve.py: 
	make conflicts stop tracing back when it gets a pkgobj closes rhbug
	#204171

2006-08-30 11:17  mjs

	* yum/packageSack.py: Faster and more memory efficient
	implementation of matchPackageNames()

2006-08-29 11:51  skvidal

	* yum/: __init__.py, packages.py: 
	make 'yum provides' stop backtracing on provides add providesnames
	property to package objects

2006-08-29 10:27  slack

	* yum/packageSack.py: Found a few more returnPackageTuple() methods
	and replaced with po.pkgtup

2006-08-29 02:47  skvidal

	* yum/: packageSack.py, sqlitesack.py: 
	- typo in sqlitesack that made it all break - change out
	matchPackages for matchPackageNames() as that's what it is doing  
	- convert to a generator for memory use   - simplify what it does

2006-08-29 01:17  skvidal

	* yum/sqlitesack.py: 
	fix up YumAvailablePackageSqlite.returnSimple() - if you select %s
	and pass it in on the cursor.execute with sqlite you end up with a
	quoted string. So "select %s from foo", ('somevar')
	
	results in this:
	
	select 'somevar' from foo
	
	which means EVERY answer you get back will be 'somevar' and not the
	value in the row for that column.
	
	If anyone knows how to turn off that quoting per-variable in
	sqlite, let me know - the docs didn't have it.
	
	We also needed an simple-dict to db column-name map so querying for
	certain things would return the right information.

2006-08-28 08:45  skvidal

	* yum/packageSack.py: 
	note about how to make this a generator-capable interface

2006-08-27 16:07  skvidal

	* yum/: packageSack.py, rpmsack.py, sqlitesack.py: 
	
	implement matchPackages() - the equivalent of
	packages.parsePackages() inside PackageSack.PackageSack remove
	repoid optional argument from simplePkgList as it was used nowhere.
	 store results of anysack.simplePkgList() in anysack.pkglist and
	return from there if called multiple times.

2006-08-25 13:30  tambet

	* cli.py: 2006-08-25  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>
	
		* cli.py (YumBaseCli.installPkgs): Use objects instead of
	tuples,
		comparision works only with objects.

2006-08-25 11:57  katzj

	* yum/sqlitesack.py: speed up sqlite querying a bit by only looking
	things up in the appropriate sqlitedb and also only getting what we
	want

	packages.py:  - remove unused methods

2006-08-25 00:25  skvidal

	* yum/: packageSack.py, packages.py: 
	- clean up a few uses of compareEVR - add requires, conflicts,
	provides, obsoletes properties to package objects - add a
	remote_path attribute to YumAvailablePackage objects for easier
	reference

2006-08-24 16:08  katzj

	* yum/rpmsack.py: don't do this check at runtime.  it fails if you
	have an empty rpmdb.  and since we have no fallback, it doesn't
	help us much.  we just need to Requires: a new enough version of
	rpm-python to support this

2006-08-24 11:21  skvidal

	* yum/: Errors.py, repos.py: 
	added Chris Lumens patch for duplicate-repo detection error

2006-06-13 14:00  katzj

	* yum/misc.py: fix syntax error

2006-06-13 12:03  katzj

	* yum/sqlitesack.py: uniqify the file list.  this avoids the fact
	that with the C-parser and the filesystem package, the list of
	files ends up with / at the end and so we end up with double
	entries.  since we can't have duplicate filenames in a directory
	anyway, unique fixes

2006-06-12 23:46  skvidal

	* yum/packageSack.py: 
	make global excludes work again - packgeSack.MetaSack.delPackage
	needs to be able to delete the pkg object asked for in each/every
	sack or global excludes fail to do anything
	
	jeremy told me I had to mention that this is all jbowes' fault when
	I fixed it. :)

2006-06-11 23:54  skvidal

	* yum.spec: 
	remove yum-arch

2006-06-09 17:17  skvidal

	* cli.py, yum/repoMDObject.py: apply lewk's patch to fix jeremy's
	lambda (iiiiiiiiiick) make corrupt repomd.xml's do the right thing
	in the new celementree repomd.xml parser

2006-06-06 23:40  katzj

	* cli.py: and actually save with the comment explaining this...

2006-06-06 23:31  katzj

	* yum-updatesd.py: lots of work to get this to do more of what's
	needed for puplet.  high-level summary: * add support for automatic
	downloading of updates when available * add support for automatic
	installation of updates when available * make emitters more
	object-y so that we can emit more types of signals more   easily. 
	dbus is probably the most fleshed out right now * threads for
	updates/downloading so that we can continue to interact   with the
	daemon while these occur * little bit more command-line fun for
	ease-of-debugging

2006-06-06 23:27  katzj

	* cli.py: use generic getKeyForPackage

2006-06-06 23:26  katzj

	* yum/__init__.py: move gpg key fetching code into core library;
	use a callback function so that we can determine whether or not to
	import if user interaction is needed cleanly between, eg, yum tui
	and pirut

2006-06-05 23:53  katzj

	* yum/yumRepo.py: fix getting group data

2006-06-05 23:18  katzj

	* docs/Makefile: likewise

2006-06-05 23:18  katzj

	* Makefile: no more yum-arch

2006-06-04 15:56  mjs

	* yum/plugins.py: Fixed missing comma

2006-06-04 15:48  mjs

	* cli.py, yum/__init__.py, yum/config.py, yum/plugins.py: Allow
	plugins to add and manipulate Yum's configuration file options in
	the same way as they are defined in Yum. This means that plugin
	option defines are far more flexible and powerful than before. The
	old API (registerOpt) still exists but is deprecated (with a saner
	implementation). I will update the wiki with info on how plugins
	can now define their own options.
	
	This cleans up a lot of plugin related code but changes the Yum API
	slightly wrt to initialisation. Documentation about this to come on
	yum-devel.
	
	This commit also includes Misa's (misa+yum@redhat.com) patch to add
	a config option for specifying the directories to look in for
	plugin configuration files.

2006-05-30 06:15  tambet

	* yum/: __init__.py, packages.py, storagefactory.py, yumRepo.py:
	2006-05-30  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>
	
		* yum/storagefactory.py: Implement. The yumRepo class got a
	little
		crowded with all of these "try to import _sqlitecache,
	sqlite, etc...".
	
		* yum/yumRepo.py (YumPackageSack.populate): Use
	repo.storage to
		get cache handler.
		(YumRepository.__init__): Use storagefactory to get package
	sack.
	
		* yum/packages.py (RpmBase.inPrcoRange): Fix the leftover
		mdUtils.compareEVR usage.
	
		* yum/__init__.py (YumBase.__init__): Log the used storage
	name.

2006-05-28 08:12  skvidal

	this work

2006-05-24 17:42  skvidal

	remove some unused imports

2006-05-24 14:41  pnasrat

	* yum/: repos.py, yumRepo.py: Enable failure_callbacks on mirror
	objects

2006-05-24 10:37  katzj

	* yum/__init__.py: keeping around older Extras packages, we can end
	up with some pretty pathological multilib cases around noarch
	packages.
	
	Having both x86_64 and noarch of the same package installed is
	non-sensical.  But we want to allow switching from native -> noarch
	and back.  So, let's take into account that noarch is a third case
	beyond base arch and compat arch.
	
	With that, we get to where there are four basic cases of newest
	packages 1) No noarch packages.  This ends up with what we have
	today where you install the base arch and the compat arch if
	available 2) Only noarch packages.  This also ends up like present
	3) Noarch package that's newer than the basearch package.  This
	means that we want the noarch package and not the basearch or
	compat-arch 4) Noarch package that's older than the basearch
	package.  This means we want the basearch and compat-arch if it
	exists
	
	rh #189998

2006-05-24 10:15  tambet

	* yum/storagefactory.py: file storagefactory.py was initially added

2006-05-19 18:15  katzj

	* yum-updatesd.py: okay, every 10 seconds is a little bit often...
	:-)

2006-05-19 17:39  katzj

	* yum-updatesd.py, etc/yum-updatesd.conf: a variety of things as I
	start to hook up proto-puplet * some consistency fixes to make
	service names all edu.duke.linux.yum, object paths differ between
	the signaller and the listener but that makes sense * add a
	--no-fork mode so that you can use ctrl-c and hack on this more
	easily * add a ShutDown method (disabled by default) since I was
	getting hit by	 the sigint catcher a few times * add a
	GetUpdatesInfo method to return the information on the available  
	updates.  this should probably be changed to return the information
	in   an async fashion, but I'll get there

2006-05-11 17:06  mjs

	* yum/plugins.py: Committed Michael Chapman's patch for bug #596.
	Plugin defined repository options weren't being read from the
	repository config but from the main config instead.

2006-05-07 18:54  skvidal

	* yum-updatesd.py: 
	updatesd changes:  - works as a daemon and uses a gobject mainloop
	dtrt  - exports a dbus system bus method to allow for triggering to
	check for    updates - uses name = edu.duke.linux.yum.Updatesd,
	object=/Updatesd,  with the method "CheckNow"  - emits a dbus
	system bus signal if updates are available: membername is
	UpdatesAvailableSignal - the string tells how many are available.  
	- emits a dbus system bus signal if updates are NOT available
	membername  is: NoUpdatesAvailableSignal

2006-05-07 16:46  skvidal

2006-03-02 16:20  skvidal

	* yum/pgpmsg.py: 
	reverse the sort order of the displayed user id from gpg keys. 
	This is more likely to get us the most recent and hopefully most
	correct user id.

2006-03-02 10:11  pnasrat

	support

	fix for yum provides foocommand not working
	
	this, ultimately, means that yum provides *foocommand* will be VERY
	SLOW for dumb reasons.
	
	there needs to be a better solution than this but at least this
	solution is functionally correct, albeit slow

2006-02-27 19:29  katzj

	* cli.py, yum/__init__.py: 
	- remove useless log output - make 'yum search' use
	searchGenerator()

2006-02-22 01:30  skvidal

	* yum/__init__.py: 
	first stab at making the search function a generator.  In order to
	maintain API I made a searchGenerator() method which is used by
	searchPackages to get the same result. searchGenerator should be
	much lighter on memory for big searches and give you more immediate
	results.  Additionally, you don't need the search callback as
	results are yielded immediately upon finding them.
	
	need to port searchPackageProvides() to use a generator as well.

2006-02-05 17:03  mjs

	* yum/plugins.py: Applied Paul Nasrat's patch to make plugins group
	aware with some changes.  Since group information is only available

2006-01-12 01:03  skvidal

	* yum/packages.py: fix KeyError when no base in location

2005-12-15 13:50  katzj

	* yum/config.py: inherit the repo being enabled from the base
	config per seth's request :)

2005-12-14 16:17  katzj

	* yum/: config.py, repos.py: better fix for the mirror problem. 
	ensure we set the value if it doesn't exist in the repo object. 
	also, default enabled/groupsenabled to 0 in the repo since we'll
	override if the config says one.
	
	RepoConf and Repository really do need to be merged...

2005-12-14 14:12  katzj

	object once and allow it to be either installed or from the sacks. 
	tested with a) yum update libgcj on a system where updating gcj

	depending on gnome-vfs2 c) yum remove gnome-vfs2
	
	The only case I didn't check was the obsoletes case, but it looks
	like the right thing should happen

2005-12-13 22:55  katzj

	* yum/__init__.py: 
	fix for a small problem in searchPackages()

2005-03-27 06:51  mjs

	* cli.py, yum/__init__.py, yum/config.py, yum/plugins.py: More
	plugin related updates:     - rearranged plugin initialisation:    
	    - YumBase.doPluginSetup() now exists and must be called to
	initialise	     plugins.	       - Yum's config and command
	line args are now parsed before plugins are	       initialised.
	This fixes the problems with the debug level being	     
	ignored for early plugin related output.	  - refactored the
	plugin config registration stuff so its handled 	   outside
	of config.py (much cleaner).	      - because yum config is
	parsed before plugin initialisation, a separate 	  
	plugin.conf is no longer required. Moved plugin settings to [main]
	of	      yum.conf.      - cleaned up YumPlugins.run() (return
	code not used anymore)	    - fixed up the levels on some plugin
	related log output

2005-03-27 04:22  skvidal

	* cli.py, shell.py: 
	modify order of args for cli.doRepoSetup() make todo list in
	shell.py

2005-03-27 04:13  skvidal

	* shell.py: 
	change semantic for repos commands in shell, add in list
	functionality:
	
	yum shell:    repos list - lists repositories and their states	 
	repos enable <repolist> - enables a list of repositories (space    
				 separated)    repos disable <repolisT> -
	disables a list of repositories (space				   
	 separated)

2005-03-27 03:46  skvidal

	* cli.py, output.py, shell.py, yummain.py, yum/__init__.py,
	yum/repos.py: 
	add 'enablerepo' and 'disablerepo' commands to yum shell.   -
	modified doRepoSetup() to take a thisrepo setup argument so we can
	setup	  one repo at a time   - modified the
	RepoStorage.populateSack() so that the repos list is checked	 if
	it is repoids or repo objects and used correctly   - We might want
	to think about a YumBase.reset() function that resets the    
	internal state of the object.
	
	- cleaned up some garbage comments and white space in yummain.py
	and cli.py

2005-03-27 02:58  mjs

	* cli.py, yum/__init__.py, yum/plugins.py: - modified doRepoSetup
	so that cli.py calls YumBase to do most of the work.	This makes
	the code cleaner (less duplication) and means the call for the	 
	reposetup plugin hook is only in one place.  - added call reposetup
	plugin hook

2005-03-27 02:31  mjs

	* cli.py, yum/__init__.py, yum/plugins.py: Moved __version__ to
	yum/__init__.py Added getYumVersion() to PluginConduit

2005-03-26 23:42  skvidal

	* rpmUtils/transaction.py: 
	remove old TransactionData class

2005-03-26 22:21  mjs

	* yum/: __init__.py, config.py, constants.py, plugins.py: Lots of
	plugin related changes:     - API versioning	 - cleaned up API
	somewhat     - hook methods now need a "_hook" suffix. This will
	allow detection of	 plugins that are trying to register hooks
	that aren't supported.	    - plugin hook method return codes are
	now ignored. Plugins should now use	   PluginYumExit exception

	add constants.py - generic constants so we don't have to do so many

	* yummain.py, yum/__init__.py, yum/sqlitesack.py: 
	- made excludeArches in repomd pkgsack and sqlite pkgsack.  - makes

	pychecker found some rather dumb, and apparently infrequently
	encountered problems.

2005-03-02 17:18  mjs

	* cli.py, output.py, yum/mdcache.py, yum/repos.py,

	queries that are not regular expressions by using database queries
	instead of iterating over all packages.

2005-03-02 09:28  gijs

	remove 2 old debug messages.

2005-03-02 09:24  gijs

	seperator for a list of files now. Cleaned up this stuff by using
	python's split and join instead of our own code.

	* output.py, yum/sqlitesack.py: Fixes in Changelog handling code,
	mostly contributed by Panu Matilainen.

2005-03-01 09:08  skvidal

	* etc/Makefile: 
	patch from terje rosten for me being a dumbass

2005-03-01 07:53  mjs

	* yum/sqlitecache.py: Added missing "rpm_packager" column mapping
	to PackageToDBAdapter . This, combined with BaseEntry.__getitem__()
	behaviour (fixed) was causing packagers to be cached as None,
	causing "yum search" to fail.

2005-03-01 07:45  mjs

	* yum/mdparser.py: Entry __getitem__() no longer returns None for
	unknown values. This was hiding bugs when the entry parameters were
	being accessed with the wrong name.
	
	'pkgid' parameter now called 'pkgId' to suit database.

2005-02-27 17:34  gijs

	* callback.py, cli.py, yum/__init__.py, yum/depsolve.py,
	yum/packages.py, yum/transactioninfo.py: 
	- added in Terje's new patch for the rpm callback - setup some
	background for some items in transactioninfo.py - specifically

	made pkgtup an attribute of every package object rather than a
	callable method.

2005-02-11 04:10  skvidal

	* cli.py, yum/__init__.py, yum/config.py, yum/repos.py: 
	rearranged repository configuration. Instead of repos being an
	attribute of the config class it is now split out as a base

	resetting information in repositories

	default is no tsflags.

2005-01-31 03:32  skvidal

	* cli.py, yummain.py, yum/__init__.py: 
	Very early implementation of a yum shell.  For most very simple
	cases it appears to work.  It doesn't look very pretty, though.

2005-01-31 00:28  skvidal

	* cli.py: 
	crack resulting from this weekends 'resolvedep'
	
	for all the apt addicts who seem to think this command matters: yum
	install /some/path/to/some/file
	
	it will search the provide files for a match and install the
	package providing that.
	
	it doesn't work for updates it doesn't work for erases don't ask.

	However, you will pay the performance penalty of importing the
	repository metadata if you do it w/install

2004-10-15 02:48  skvidal

2004-08-30 01:35  skvidal

	make caching mode/user mode work again - silly caches, tricks are
	for kids!

2004-08-30 01:13  skvidal

	* cli.py, yum/packages.py, rpmUtils/transaction.py: 
	update takes options now obsoletes should work better - a touch

2004-08-29 19:44  skvidal

	* cli.py, yum/__init__.py, yum/config.py, rpmUtils/miscutils.py,
	rpmUtils/transaction.py, yum/depsolve.py, yum/repos.py: 
	- installroot now works - fix depsolving for filedeps in certain
	situations - clean up cruft in all sorts of places

2004-08-29 04:05  skvidal

	* cli.py, yum/__init__.py, rpmUtils/updates.py: 
	--obsoletes working fixed extras

	empty repository fix and clean up debug print's

2004-08-27 02:55  skvidal

	* cli.py, yum/depsolve.py, yum/packages.py, rpmUtils/miscutils.py:

	* yum/__init__.py: 
	additional output/debugging strings

2004-08-23 02:58  skvidal

	* cli.py, yum/config.py: 
	- make a numrecent option in the yum.conf - refine the
	functionality of yum list recent (and hence generate-rss) a bit   -
	The concept of what 'recent' means will need to be refined
	considerably	 right now it's pretty	much a sort by file
	timestamp, not much more.      it really should be something more
	related to relative age to system      date. There is much room for
	refinement and anyone wishing to undertake	that refinement is
	quite welcome to do so. :)

2004-08-23 02:41  skvidal

	* cli.py:

	whitespace fix in rpmUtils fix docstring in yum/packages.py

2004-08-23 01:08  skvidal

	* yum/: __init__.py, config.py: 
	- make excludes work - this might require some re-implementation as
	it currently removes the   packageobject from the pkgSack. This is
	fine, but it takes time to do this.
	
	A couple of options:  - simply make a list of excluded
	packageobjects and check that during	listing and depresolution
	(this is kinda icky b/c we end up doing lots of    checks
	throughout all of yum)	- delete the objects from the pkgsack and
	add them to an excluded sack so we    can query on them later.

2004-08-23 01:01  skvidal

	* yum/depsolve.py: 
	removed wrongly named and redundant method call

2004-08-22 16:35  skvidal

	* yum/depsolve.py: 
	removed old function stubs

2004-08-22 05:09  skvidal

	* output.py: 
	- added guid to each package item.  - more info to non-xhtml output
	- need to pass in repos object or figure another way to get   valid
	link locations for packages.

2004-08-22 03:59  rtomayko

	* output.py: Fixed a few generateRSS bugs: - ChangeLog entries
	don't have dates. Removed from format.	- Put a pre tag around
	changelog text in description. Readers that don't   understand
	xhtml:body were stripping linear whitespace.

2004-08-22 03:10  rtomayko

	* output.py: Fixed bad indent (some lines were 2 spaces)

2004-08-22 02:44  rtomayko

	* output.py: First crack at implementing generate-rss command. 
	I've been testing with:
	
	  python yummain.py -c yum.conf -d 0 generate-rss > yum.rss
	
	The generated file should be valid RSS 2.0. All required elements
	are present and there should be no chance of outputting ill-formed
	XML. Some other implementation notes of interest:
	
	  * Item title's are set to the package's n-e.v-r.a
	  * Item pubDate's are set to the package's buildtime.
	  * The content for an item is the package's summary, followed by
	    the description, followed by the changelog.
	  * The ChangeLog for a package contains only the last three
	entries.
	
	Some notes for the future:
	
	  * The entire RSS feed is being built up within a single libxml2
	    document. If we want to extend this to build arbitrarily large
	    feeds, we may need to output each item as we go instead of
	waiting
	    until the whole feed is built.
	
	  * Might be nice to add an output file argument for convienience
	(-d 0
	    and redirecting stdout is slightly annoying). Should just work.

2004-08-19 03:47  skvidal

	* callback.py, yum/repos.py: 
	fix caching code for pkg download bug in callback on erasures

2004-08-19 03:27  skvidal

	* yummain.py, yum/depsolve.py, yum/packages.py,
	rpmUtils/__init__.py:

	speed up the depsolver a bit

	when you yum -d # - the number is what level of those logs you want
	to see.
	
	if the number is 3 then you see all logs at level 3 or lower (this
	only effects the 'log' object - errorlog and filelog ALWAYS happen)
	
	yum -d 0 should show nothing b/c there is nothing that low.

2002-06-11 10:07  skvidal

	with the others will win.
	
	pkgpolicy=newest (or nothing) will mean the newest pkgs get into
	the headerInfonevral.
