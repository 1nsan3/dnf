.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIyup\&.conf\fP file is the configuration file for

should be used by default as well as specifying the location of the
distribution being used\&.
.SH GENERAL OPTIONS

\fIyup\&.conf\fP file and have the option and its value separated by
whitespace.  
.PP
.IP "\fB\&.master\fP"
\fB\&.master\fP is used to specify the Internet location of the yup
master file which allows you to easily choose a mirror site for your
specific distribution\&.  Value is the URL of the master file\&.
.PP
.IP "\fB\&.dist-option\fP"
\fB\&.dist-option\fP is used to specify the name of the distribution
which you are currently running\&.  Value is the name and version of
the distribution\&.
.PP
.IP "\fB\&.arch-option\fP"
\fB\&.arch-option\fP specifies what the primary architecture you wish
to update is\&.  Value is main architecture of RPMS such as i386 or ppc\&.
.PP
.IP "\fB\&.passive-ftp\fP"
\fB\&.passive-ftp\fP specifies whether or not passive FTP transfers
should be used\&.  Value is \fIy\fP or \fIn\fP\&.
.PP
.IP "\fB\&.assume-yes\fP"
\fB\&.assume-yes\fP specifies that the answer to any questions asked
should be yes\&.   Value is \fIy\fP or \fIn\fP\&.
.PP
.IP "\fB\&.quiet\fP"
\fB\&.quiet\fP specifies that no warnings should be displayed, only
errors, in a way suitable for running in an automated fashion\&.
Value is \fIy\fP or \fIn\fP\&.
.PP
.IP "\fB\&.really-quiet\fP"
\fB\&.really-quiet\fP specifies that no warnings or errors should be
displayed.  This is good only if you want to get no output from
\fByup\fP\&. Value is \fIy\fP or \fIn\fP\&.
.PP
.IP "\fB\&.ignore-deps\fP"
\fB\&.ignore-deps\fP specifies that yup's internal dependency check
should be skipped\&.  Value is \fIy\fP or \fIn\fP\&.
.PP
.IP "\fB\&.skip-install\fP"
\fB\&.skip-install\fP specifies that installation of any packages
should be skipped; instead, they should just be downloaded\&. Value is
\fIy\fP or \fIn\fP\&.
.PP
.IP "\fB\&.auto-clean\fP"
\fB\&.auto-clean\fP specifies that package files should be removed
after they are installed rather than leaving them in the cache directory\&.
Value is \fIy\fP or \fIn\fP\&.
.PP
.IP "\fB\&.logfile\fP"
\fB\&.logfile\fP specifies a file which yup should append information
about all package operations to\&.  Value is the file to use\&.
.PP
.IP "\fB\&.cachedir\fP"
\fB\&.cachedir\fP specifies the base directory which should be used
for storing all of \fByup's\fP cached information such as package
lists and packages.  If unspecified, defaults to
\fI/var/cache/yup\fP\&.  Value is the directory to use\&.
.PP
.IP "\fB\&.exclude\fP"
\fB\&.exclude\fP specifies the name of a package which should never be
modified\&.  If the name does not match any package in the remote
list, it is assumed to be a shell glob and any matched packages are
excluded as though they were individually listed\&.  There can be
multiple \fB\&.exclude\fP lines in the \fIyup.conf\fP file\f&.  An
example \&.exclude line would look like
.IP
.nf
\&.exclude kernel*
.fi
to exclude all packages named \fIkernel*\fP

.SH MIRROR SELECTION
The other thing specified in the \fIyup.conf\fP file is information
regarding the mirror to use\&.  This section is a separate block which
should look like
.IP
.nf
\&.begin        mirror-option
  \&.name       Yellow Dog Linux Official Mirror
  \&.country    USA
  \&.addr       ftp://ftp.yellowdoglinux.com/pub/yellowdog/champion-1.2/

be an FTP site (\fBftp://url\fP), an HTTP site (\fBhttp://url\fP), or
a local file location (\fBfile://absolute_path\fP)\&.  Note that the
actual location of the remote packages is this location with the
architecture appended\&.
.PP
.IP "\fB\&.arch\fP"
\fB\&.arch\fP gives the architecture of the files in the remote
